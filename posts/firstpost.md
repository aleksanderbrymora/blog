I had the idea to start a dev-log for a long time, as I needed a dump of thoughts and maybe something to look back to in the future. I also need a break from just coding and to enjoy a bit of writing. So here it is - here is my small dev-blog. Hope you enjoy it.

## Focuses

My main focus is to talk about the research I'm doing for my projects and sharing the 'why' for all of that. I experienced first-hand that I learn the most by explaining things to others and that's exactly what I'm aiming to do.
